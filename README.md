# Introduction

The GPars framework (http://gpars.github.io) offers Java developers intuitive and safe ways to handle
Java or Groovy tasks concurrently. Leveraging the enormous flexibility of the Groovy programing language and
building on proven Java technologies, we aim to make concurrent programming for multi-core hardware
intuitive, robust and enjoyable.

# GPars - 'coz concurrency is Groovy

The traditional thread-based concurrency model built into Java doesn't match well with the natural human
sense for parallelism. While this was not a problem at times, when the level of parallelism in software was
low and concurrency offered only limited benefits compared to sequential code, nowadays, with the number of
cores on a single main-stream chip doubling almost every year, sequential code quickly looses ground and
fails to compete in performance and hardware utilization with concurrent code.

Inevitably, for concurrent programming to be effective, the mental models of concurrent systems interactions
that people create in their heads have to respect the nature of human brains more than the wires on the
chips. Luckily, such abstractions have been around for several decades, used at universities, in telephone
switches, the super-computing industry and some other inherently concurrent domains. The current challenge
for GPars is to bring these abstractions up to the mainstream software developers to help us solve our
practical daily issues.

The framework provides straightforward Java or Groovy-based APIs to declare, which parts of the code should
be performed in parallel. Collections can have their elements processed concurrently, closures can be turned
into composable asynchronous functions and run in the background on your behalf, mutable data can be
protected by agents or software transactional memory.

For the common scenario that one or multiple results are calculated concurrently but need to be processed as
soon as they are available, GPars makes it a breeze to correctly model this with Dataflow. Dataflow
variables and channels gives you a handy abstraction of single-assignment multiple-read data elements, while
dataflow operators let you build efficient concurrent data-processing networks.

The concept of Actors as an approach to organizing concurrent activities has recently gained new popularity
(thanks to the Scala, Erlang, and other programming languages). GPars implements this concept for Java and
Groovy developers. With actors support you can quickly create several independent Actors, which consume
messages passed to them and communicate with other actors by sending them messages. You then build your
solution by combining these actors into a communication network.
